# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the Libra AI FAQ! This comprehensive guide addresses the most common questions about using Libra, from getting started to advanced features. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, don't hesitate to reach out to our community on [Forum](https://forum.libra.dev) where our team and community members are always ready to help.

## Getting Started

### What is Libra AI?

Libra AI is an open-source, full-stack application generation platform that combines the rapid UI generation experience of V0 with the backend flexibility of modern development tools. It's completely self-hostable with no vendor lock-in, giving you complete control over your code, data, and design system.

### How is Libra different from V0 or Lovable?

While V0 provides instant UI generation but lacks backend flexibility and self-hosting options, and other platforms may tie you to specific databases or billing models, Libra combines the best of both worlds:

- **Complete ownership**: Your domain, database, design system - switch freely
- **Lightning-fast development**: One-click UI + backend generation, ready to use
- **Unlimited extensibility**: Open source, self-hostable, no vendor dependencies
- **Technology stack freedom**: Support for multiple mainstream frameworks and database combinations

### Do I need coding experience to use Libra?

No! Libra is designed to be accessible to users of all skill levels:

- **Beginners**: Use AI generators and templates to get started quickly
- **Intermediate developers**: Customize components and business logic
- **Advanced developers**: Deep customization and platform extension

Building with Libra is an excellent way to learn web development in a practical, hands-on manner, with AI support always available to guide you through the process.

### What can I build with Libra?

You can create a wide range of applications including:

- **Content Websites**: Blogs, portfolios, marketing sites, and documentation
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Online stores with payment processing and inventory management
- **Productivity Apps**: Task managers, note-taking apps, and collaboration tools
- **Social Applications**: Community platforms, forums, and social networks
- **Business Tools**: CRM systems, dashboards, and analytics platforms
- **Educational Platforms**: Learning management systems and course websites

## Troubleshooting

### My application shows a blank page

This usually indicates a build or configuration issue. Try these steps:

1. **Check the console**: Open browser developer tools and look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure all required variables in `.env` are properly set
3. **Clear cache**: Delete `node_modules`, `.turbo`, and `.next` directories, then reinstall dependencies
4. **Check database connections**: Verify your database URLs and credentials are correct

### I'm getting console errors

Common console errors and solutions:

- **Module not found**: Run `bun install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Environment variable undefined**: Check your `.env` file configuration
- **Database connection failed**: Verify your database URLs and network connectivity
- **Type errors**: Run `bun run typecheck` to identify and fix TypeScript issues

### The application isn't responsive on mobile

Libra applications are built with responsive design by default. If you're experiencing mobile issues:

1. **Check viewport meta tag**: Ensure it's properly configured in your layout
2. **Test responsive breakpoints**: Use browser dev tools to test different screen sizes
3. **Review custom CSS**: Check if any custom styles override responsive behavior
4. **Update components**: Ensure you're using the latest version of UI components

### Build or deployment failures

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Check dependencies**: Run `bun install` to ensure all packages are up to date
2. **Clear build cache**: Delete `.turbo` and build directories
3. **Verify environment**: Ensure all required environment variables are set for production
4. **Check logs**: Review build logs for specific error messages
5. **Test locally**: Ensure the application builds successfully in your local environment
