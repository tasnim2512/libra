# Libra Project Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of the Libra project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education level, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Libra is committed to building a fully open-source, self-custodial, unrestricted tech stack, developer-friendly, and community-driven full-stack application platform. We encourage all individuals to participate in a respectful, collaborative, and innovative manner, promoting the prosperity of the Libra ecosystem.

## Our Standards

The following behaviors help create a positive community environment:

* Show empathy and kindness toward others
* Respect different viewpoints, experiences, and technical backgrounds
* Be willing to provide and receive constructive feedback
* Take responsibility, acknowledge mistakes, and continually improve
* Prioritize the common interests of the community and ecosystem over personal interests
* Encourage knowledge sharing, open-source collaboration, and innovative practices

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable:

* Using sexually suggestive language or imagery, or engaging in any form of sexual harassment
* Engaging in malicious attacks, insults, discrimination, provocation, or political attacks
* Engaging in harassment, whether in public or private
* Publishing others' private information (e.g., address, email) without permission
* Any behavior that is reasonably considered unprofessional in a professional setting

## Enforcement Duties

Libra community maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct and will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, submissions, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this code of conduct and to explain the reasons for their decisions.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all Libra community spaces, including but not limited to GitHub, Discord, the official website, documentation, online/offline events, etc. Any behavior representing the Libra community (e.g., using official email addresses, social media accounts, or acting as an event representative) is also subject to this code.

## Enforcement

If you witness or experience any abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community maintainers at contact@libra.dev. All complaints will be promptly, fairly reviewed and investigated.

Community maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter. Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce this code of conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent community restrictions, as determined by the project leadership team.

## Acknowledgements

This code of conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), with localization adjustments based on the open-source principles, tech stack, and community culture of the Libra project.

The "Community Impact Guidelines" were inspired by Mozilla's "Code of Conduct Enforcement Ladder" (https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).
